# HostelManagementSystem

A Management System basically made for hostels as in hostel they are still using the same old system of registration and record of student who have been enrolled
in thier hostels. To solve this problem I came up with an idea of making a Hostel Manangement System in which one can keep the record of students who have been enrolled
in thier hostels. To make it much better I will be trying to add it the attendance feature so that it could be easy for students to scan the QR and just mark themself as
present.

Day 1:- UI for Login and SignUp Page both for the user and the admin
Day 2:- Firebase Authentication for signing up the admin and exceptional handling
Day 3:- Use Realtime Firebase to store the Admins data and show them. As well as made datePicker for date of birth field.
